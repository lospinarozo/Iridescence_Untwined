DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. File List: 

	- 1.IridescentDisc_RawSpectralData: Raw spectra of the iridescent disc in different angles of the light and collector. Used to study the temporal component
	- 2.GreyBackgrounds_RawSpectralData: Raw spectra of the grey backgrounds in front of which the stimulus were presented
	- 3.Distractors_RawSpectralData: Raw spectra of different patches of each of the colorful distractors. Used to study the spatial component
	- 4.BlueStimulus_RawSpectralData: Raw spectrum of the blue stimulus. Used to compare our results with bee's innate preference towards blue
	- 5.BeeChoices_TrainingPhase: Raw behavioural choices of honey bees during the training phase (60 rewarded choices)
	- 6.BeeChoices_TestingPhase: Raw behavioural choices of honey bees during the four unrewarded testing conditions

2. Relationship between files, if important: 
	- File 2.GreyBackgrounds_RawSpectralData is required for the visual models of data in the other three files, since it corresponds to the gray background in which all stimulus wer epresented to the bees, therefore it can affect their perception. 
	
3. Are there multiple versions of the dataset? no

4. Relationship with the manuscript: Figures 3, 5, S3, S4 and statistical analysis in the manuscript were produced with this data set. 



METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

All the spectra were obtained with a a PX-2 pulsed Xenon light and a USB 2000+ spectrometer coupled to a goniometer to allow different angular combinations of incident light and collector, except for the blue stimulus.
For almost all data sets we used 

	- 1.IridescentDisc_RawSpectralData: Due to the structures in our stimulus, the effect of iridescence can only be detected with non-point illumination. Thus, rather than using fibre optics at a precise angle, we located a light source at 15 different positions 
					    Then, we varied varied the observer angles in the plane perpendicular to the sample, from 5° to a maximum of 20° from the normal. 
	- 2.GreyBackgrounds_RawSpectralData: We considered only the specular angle: 10° light incidence and 10° angle for the collector
	- 3.Distractors_RawSpectralData: We considered only the specular angle: 10° light incidence and 10° angle for the collector
					 To avoid artifacts, we first sampled the dominant colour patches within each distractor and printed them separately to measure their spectra.
	- 4.BlueStimulus_RawSpectralData: This spectra was obtained with an integrating sphere. 
	- 5.BeeChoices_TrainingPhase: Behavioral choices were recorded by LN 
	- 6.BeeChoices_TestingPhase: Behavioral choices were recorded by LN

2. Methods for processing the data: 
	- Spectral measurements were recorded using the software OceanView 1.6.7. 

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
Spectral measurements were recorded using the software OceanView 1.6.7. and analyzed with R programing language particularly the R package PAVO (Maia et al. 2019). 
Behavioral data was also analyzed with the R programming language. 

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: 
The reflectance per wavelength is reported as a % compared to a reference. 
We calibrated against a low reflectance mirror standard (Ocean Optics STAN-SSH) for iridescent samples (File 1), and against a diffuse 99% reflectance spectralon standard (Labsphere, North Sutton, NH, USA) for the distractors (File 2,3 and 4)
Recalibration to the same standard was conducted every time we changed the angle combination in directional measurements, or the patch measured. 
Sometimes for the iridescence stimulus, we obtained measurements above 100%. This is not a problem since all the measurements are relative to the same standard

5. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: 
We conducted multiple pilot measurements until we obtained high quality spectra with the different techniques described in the paper.
