 Data and Code for the paper Iridescence Untwined


Find the HTML interactive version of the code here: https://l-ospina-rozo.shinyapps.io/IridescenceUntwined/#Introduction 

Note: The interactive HTML file was created in RMarkdown using the app shiny and we used shinyapp.io to publish it. This is the reason why the Data files and script had to remain in the same folder. 

The HTML link may take a couple of minutes to load. If there is any other issue, please contact the authors ([lospinarozo](https://github.com/lospinarozo) or Leslie Ng) directly.
